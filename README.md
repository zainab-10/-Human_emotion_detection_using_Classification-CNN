## Human Emotion Detection using Classification CNN
Welcome to the "Human Emotion Detection using Classification CNN" GitHub repository!
Here, I present a powerful solution for recognizing human emotions from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
My project not only focuses on accurate emotion classification but also offers a user-friendly web interface and insightful plots to visualize model results.

## Introduction
Understanding human emotions is crucial in various fields, from psychology to human-computer interaction. 
Our project employs a Classification CNN, a robust deep learning architecture, to automatically classify emotions from facial expressions in images.
By accurately detecting emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, our solution has the potential to 
enhance various applications like sentiment analysis and user experience design.

## Web Interface
We've developed an interactive web interface that allows users to upload images and receive real-time emotion predictions. 
This interface provides a practical demonstration of the model's capabilities and showcases its seamless integration into real-world applications. 

## Model Results and Plots
The repository includes visualizations of our model's performance, including plots depicting accuracy and loss trends during training. 
These plots offer insights into the training process and highlight the model's learning behavior. 
Understanding these metrics is invaluable for fine-tuning and improving model accuracy.
